# Huawei Firewall Security Zone Implementation
A comprehensive network security project implementing three-zone architecture using Huawei firewall technologies.

## 🛡️Project Overview
This project demonstrates enterprise-grade network security using Huawei firewall with three-zone segmentation (Trust, Untrust, DMZ) to enforce layered security policies and protect critical assets.

## 📋Key Features
- **Three-Zone Architecture**: Trust (Internal), Untrust (Externet), DMZ (Public Services)
- **Security Policy Implementation**: Granular control over inter-zone communication
- **DMZ Isolation**: Secure hosting of public-facing services
- **NAT Configuration**: Secure external connectivity with address translation
- **Access Control**: Role-based traffic filtering and threat prevention

## 🔧Technical Implementation
- **Firewall**: Huawei USG Series
- **Simulation**: eNSP Platform

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Enterprise Firewall Configuration
- Security Zone Architecture
- Access Control List (ACL) Management
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Threat Mitigation Strategies
- Security Policy Design

*Developed as part of HCIA-Security certification preparation and practical cybersecurity training.*
